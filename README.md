This project is a BMI Classification Model that predicts an individualâ€™s BMI category (Extremely Weak, Weak, Normal, Overweight, Obesity, Extreme Obesity) based on their Gender, Height, and Weight. The model is built using PyTorch, trained with a Neural Network, and evaluated with accuracy and classification reports.
